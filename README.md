# CdeBaca_Quantifed_Self_Project
Quantified Self Project: Screen Time Data Tracking, Isabella CdeBaca, CPSC 222, Fall 2020Â¶
My project is organized into four sections: Introduction, Data Analysis, Classification Results, and Conclusion. I wanted to make my project as easy to navigate as possible, so I combined everything into one Jupyter Notebook. Each category is distinctly labeled and contains a written portion and a code portion. The written portion provides written information about each section. The code portion will run if you click run. The code portion is meant to build off the written information.
